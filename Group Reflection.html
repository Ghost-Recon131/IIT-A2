            Our group had a good plan of dividing all the work early, then work individually or with a partner on our
            assigned sections. This helped everyone stay on track and reduce instances of depending on another team member
            to finish a section before more work can be done. Our meetings also went well, with most of the meetings being
            active and to the point. Everyone also consistency attended. Communication could be further improved, sometimes
            there are periods where the group is a bit inactive, before picking up again. This leads to the next improving,
            time management. We started off this assignment well bit then progress slowed down towards the halfway mark
            before we picked up speed in the last week of submission. One thing that was surprising was how quickly certain
            tasks were completed, such as the Website Design and structure. Drawing diagrams for the Project Idea section
            took a bit longer than expected, around 20 minutes per diagram. One thing I learnt about group is that everyone
            needs to work together for the tasks to be completed. Just completing your own tasks and then ignore other
            sections will not work out.

            Once the groups had been decided, we quickly allocated who would be doing which sections of the assignment.
            By doing this we broke up the assignment into smaller chunks of the whole task so that everyone could work
             and concentrate on their own parts at the same time. What we struggled with was our communication halfway
             into the assignment due to a combination of mid-semester break disrupting how often we could meet, and
             everyone being preoccupied with other things. This drastically slowed down our progress with the
             assignment which showed that our time management and communication is what we should look to improve
             moving into the next assignment. What was surprising was how quickly we were able to complete our sections
             once we had started to talk to each other more in the later stages. Overall what I have learnt while working
             as a group is how vital having good communication and time management is when working with your peers and
             is hopefully something we can improve on in the next task.

            I am very happy that I had the opportunity to switch to this group and work with these active members on this assignment.
            What we did well was that we organized our work well, everyone was very active in the meetings, and everyone was very
            active in giving us me on building the template for the website. What could be improved is that we did not manage our
            time well enough, and the team needed to slow down due to the new members joining the team, it would be better if we
            could improve our overall efficiency. One thing that surprised me was the plenty of suggestions given between our team
            on both terms of the content of the reports and the production of the website, which allowed us to improve and optimize
            our content and the design of the website. And when we encountered a question, we didn't understand, there were always
            other team members available to answer it for you, which led to a very smooth process. I have therefore learnt from our
            group that suggestion is a prerequisite for success and that it is essential to suggestions as part of a group assignment
            to help each other and improve the quality of the assignment.
