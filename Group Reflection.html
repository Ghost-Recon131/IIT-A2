            Our group had a good plan of dividing all the work early, then work individually or with a partner on our
            assigned sections. This helped everyone stay on track and reduce instances of depending on another team member
            to finish a section before more work can be done. Our meetings also went well, with most of the meetings being
            active and to the point. Everyone also consistency attended. Communication could be further improved, sometimes
            there are periods where the group is a bit inactive, before picking up again. This leads to the next improving,
            time management. We started off this assignment well bit then progress slowed down towards the halfway mark
            before we picked up speed in the last week of submission. One thing that was surprising was how quickly certain
            tasks were completed, such as the Website Design and structure. Drawing diagrams for the Project Idea section
            took a bit longer than expected, around 20 minutes per diagram. One thing I learnt about group is that everyone
            needs to work together for the tasks to be completed. Just completing your own tasks and then ignore other
            sections will not work out.
