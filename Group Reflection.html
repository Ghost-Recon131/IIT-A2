            Throughout the project, the group was able to stay on track with their workload, progressing each section in
            a moderate pace. When issues would arrive whether from being sick or facing lots of work in other courses,
            we were able to help each other out by working on parts together to ease the workload. Although we could handle
            the work evenly, there would however be issues with communication, having inconsistent moments of being able
            to talk together as a full team to discuss progress. If I were to list something surprising, it would be the
            speed of the output of some of the sections involved. In some cases, when asked to make progress towards
            completing one part of the report, some members were able to finish in the same night, if not a day or two
            later. Being in a group has taught me how much progress can be made with the assistance of others, as I often
            focused on working alone previously. Being my first semester, I have learned to carefully consider the members
            in my group and how I work with them if given the opportunity.

            One thing I found worked well within our group was the ability to delegate tasks early on. Our team had
            assigned tasks within the first meeting, which personally worked well for me as I knew what I was doing from
            the get-go meaning I could get started ASAP. One thing I believe could be worked upon is collaboration within
            the team. Rather than assigning a separate task to each team member I believe in future it would be more
            beneficial to work through tasks together. If we were able to get everyone’s input not only, would it relieve
            everyone’s workload, but it would also result in a more cohesive result. One thing I found extremely surprising
            is that everyone worked on their parts, and no one had to be constantly chased up for part submission, which
            is something I have begun to expect with group work. It was pleasant to have a team where everyone contributed
            fairly. During this assignment I found that working within a group can be very enriching when you have team
            members who are contributing fairly, as mentioned above I have never had a group where everyone was doing
            their part, so again this was a nice change.

            Our group started off well as we allocated all the tasks early one and had some days and times set for our
            recordings. However even though we had a fast and efficient start, it sort of slowed down and we didn’t
            fully stick to our meeting times and days which hindered our group a bit.  We had some sections as individual
            work and we had partners set up for some of the big parts of the project. We also received a new member a
            towards the later stage of the project which was actually very beneficial as they added a lot of value to our
            group. One thing to improve upon would be to keep our pace throughout the project and not slow down like we did,
            although there were some external factors which sometimes caused the slowdown. Some of our original plans did
            change but the group put in a solid effort to get some work done but sometimes it was hard to get the input
            and ideas of other members as some didn’t input much, however they still did their parts well.  Everyone was
            willing to put in effort in this group to complete the assignment and when constructive criticism was given
            members would take it gracefully and improve upon their work instead of taking feedback in a badway.

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Jingxuan</div>

            Our group had a good plan of dividing all the work early, then work individually or with a partner on our
            assigned sections. This helped everyone stay on track and reduce instances of depending on another team member
            to finish a section before more work can be done. Our meetings also went well, with most of the meetings being
            active and to the point. Everyone also consistency attended. Communication could be further improved, sometimes
            there are periods where the group is a bit inactive, before picking up again. This leads to the next improving,
            time management. We started off this assignment well bit then progress slowed down towards the halfway mark
            before we picked up speed in the last week of submission. One thing that was surprising was how quickly certain
            tasks were completed, such as the Website Design and structure. Drawing diagrams for the Project Idea section
            took a bit longer than expected, around 20 minutes per diagram. One thing I learnt about group is that everyone
            needs to work together for the tasks to be completed. Just completing your own tasks and then ignore other
            sections will not work out.

            Once the groups had been decided, we quickly allocated who would be doing which sections of the assignment.
            By doing this we broke up the assignment into smaller chunks of the whole task so that everyone could work
             and concentrate on their own parts at the same time. What we struggled with was our communication halfway
             into the assignment due to a combination of mid-semester break disrupting how often we could meet, and
             everyone being preoccupied with other things. This drastically slowed down our progress with the
             assignment which showed that our time management and communication is what we should look to improve
             moving into the next assignment. What was surprising was how quickly we were able to complete our sections
             once we had started to talk to each other more in the later stages. Overall what I have learnt while working
             as a group is how vital having good communication and time management is when working with your peers and
             is hopefully something we can improve on in the next task.

            I am very happy that I had the opportunity to switch to this group and work with these active members on this assignment.
            What we did well was that we organized our work well, everyone was very active in the meetings, and everyone was very
            active in giving us me on building the template for the website. What could be improved is that we did not manage our
            time well enough, and the team needed to slow down due to the new members (me) joining the team, it would be better if we
            could improve our overall efficiency. One thing that surprised me was the plenty of suggestions given between our team
            on both terms of the content of the reports and the production of the website, which allowed us to improve and optimize
            our content and the design of the website. And when we encountered a question, we didn't understand, there were always
            other team members available to answer it for you, which led to a very smooth process. I have therefore learnt from our
            group that suggestion is a prerequisite for success and that it is essential to suggestions as part of a group assignment
            to help each other and improve the quality of the assignment.

        <div class="detail_content">
            As a group, we have worked well together. We’ve divided up the tasks early and reduced dependence on a team
            member to finish their task before more work can be done, increasing our efficiency. Group members were also
            open to constructive criticism and was happy to make changes or additions when suggestions were brought up
            with their work. We did not need to chase up on members to finish their work and maintained communication if
            there were problems or complications, ensuring everyone is aware of any changes or issues.

        <div class="detail_subtitle">What could be improved</div>
        <div class="detail_content">
            An area for improvement could be maintaining consistency throughout the weeks when working on the assignment.
            We had a strong start but gradually slowed down on progress, before rapidly ramping up again. Another area
            could be to have more meetings with the whole group. We averaged 1 meeting per week and mostly stuck with
            direct messages or group messaging as our primary form of communication.

            of UNI, she was able to meet the deadlines the group had set and maintained a high level of input throughout
            the whole assignment. She was also very receptive to feedback and always tried her best to do the best

            efficient, and smart worker who provided a lot of value to the group. He even took it upon himself to do some
            parts alone just to help the group when we were facing some issues with our time management.

            We learnt that time organisation is very important, and we should finish all sections slightly earlier.
            This will allow other team members to review, edit or make suggestions on how to improve the work. It was
            also important for everyone to be involved and participating. We did have deadlines and times set for parts
            to be due and meetings to be had, but another issue was meeting these demands, as everyone had a different
            schedule and a variety of things can occur at once, so whilst it can be difficult to com This will allow other

            rather than the set deadlines not being met.
