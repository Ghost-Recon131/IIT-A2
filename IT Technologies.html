            <div class="detail_line">Cybersecurity</div>
            <div class="detail_content">- Cybersecurity is a very board term for describing ways to protect users and
                data. This is a rapidly evolving industry
                and threats come in many forms, such as the following based off Microsoft's cybersecurity report (Al
                MacKinnon, 2022): <br>
                - Cyber Crime based on economic factors<br>
                - State sponsored threats<br>
                - Supply chain, IoT devices and Operational technology (OT)<br>
                - Workforce Security<br>
                - Disinformation<br>

            </div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">What can be done now? - MFA</div>
            <div class="detail_content">Increase usage of multi factor authentication (MFA) alongside existing username
                and password. MFA requires an additional
                code or prompt that the user needs to provide before access is granted, thus providing some protection
                against stolen
                login details. MFA can be implemented via push notification over an app on the user's phone such as
                Microsoft
                authenticator, sent over SMS or email as well as TOTP tokens generated by apps like Authy (Bojan
                Jovanovic, 2022). More
                advanced MFA uses biometrics to verify the user, such as Services Australia, which allows users to
                create a voiceprint
                to verify their identity (servicesaustralia, 2021).
            </div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">FIDO 2 Passwordless authentication</div>
            <div class="detail_content">Hardware authentication via WebAuthen / U2F provides an addition level of
                security, as users need to physically interact
                with the hardware module, attacks via remote desktop connection is no longer possible. FIDO 2 is a new
                password-less
                protocol that skips the need for password entirely, using just a hardware module to perform the
                cryptographic functions
                to verify a user. This process is based on the domain of the website they signed up and can't be spoofed
                by using
                phishing websites. (Kensington, 2021 and FIDO Alliance, no date).
            </div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Zero trust Model</div>
            <div class="detail_content">Zero trust means that the organisation's infrastructure is designed to no trust
                anyone operating inside (local network)
                or outside the network. It combines the use of MFA, file encryption, access control and Least-privilege
                access (Yubico,
                no date).
                Access control is generally implemented via role-based access and goes along with Least-privilege access
                which focuses
                on providing the minimal number of permissions for users to complete their tasks. ie HR department
                worker can access
                employee files and make changes on their position and pay, however cannot view their bank details which
                is restricted to
                finance department. Another important part of Zero trust is log all data. Such as logging when a user
                accessed what
                file, from which device and on what network. Logs are then stored and can be used to find suspicious
                activity or
                attempted attacks.

                detection</div>
            <div class="detail_content">ML based detection is being tried in Cybersecurity tasks now and is likely to
                get more usage in the next few years. AI
                based detecting will mainly benefit against attacks using 0-day exploits, as written in Google’s report
                (Maddie Stone
                and Clement Lecigne, 2021), there has been a consistent increase in 0-Day vulnerabilities detected
                following 2018. AI
                based techniques will use behavioural analysis discussed in (Shaukat et al., 2020) to determine threats,
                thus able to
                react in real time, potentially preventing the 0 day from being exploited until a patch is issued by
                developers.

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Blockchain security</div>
            <div class="detail_content">An example of using Blockchain technology can used to decentralise DNS’s which
                can prevent DDoS attacks targeting DNS
                servers to stop users from connecting to websites. Currently two Blockchain based DNS solutions already
                exist Namecoin
                and Blockstack, where “Each system node can act as a DNS server, where users can perform domain name
                registration,
                transmission, and data revision. The decentralization of domain name services makes it impossible for
                intruders to
                manipulate or steal the central record.” (Yassine Maleh, 2020)
            </div>

            <div class="detail_content">Blockchain can also be used to verify ownership of a document or certification.
                Borrowing the idea from NFTs, documents
                such as contracts, legal agreements, student transcripts can prove that their file is authentic, and
                they own said file.

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Government legislation</div>
            <div class="detail_content">he EU Cybersecurity Act aims to enforce better information sharing between
                companies and end users, as well as mandate
                and standardise some cybersecurity features (Devin Partida, 2022). While these security standards are
                not yet mandatory,
                there will help everyone if all businesses operating inside the EU were forced to comply with the new
                laws. The American
                ‘Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act’ aims to keep organizations honest to their customers by
                mandating the report
                of cyberattacks and ransomware payments they have made (Greig, 2022). Potentially stopping any
                organisations from trying
                to hide they were compromised and leave users in the dark about having their information stolen.

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Potential impact and changes + people effected</div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle">Companies & Developers</div>
            <div class="detail_content">More focus is needed on keeping their application / website secure. Companies
                need to devote more resources to security
                and protecting user data. Developers will need to learn new technologies, such as implementing MFA /
                WebAuthen into
                their application or adding FIDO 2 passwordless options. Need for cybersecurity professionals will
                continue and
                positions for data scientists and machine learning experts will increase when ML based threat and
                intrusion detection
                systems are created. Traditional antivirus solitons will either be phased out or incorporate more AI
                elements to compete
                with new security products.
            </div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">End users</div>
            <div class="detail_content">Increased attention for program security beneficial to end users. MFA
                technologies can help users further secure their
                account while hardware devices with FIDO 2 support can give a more seamless login experience. An
                upcoming scam filter by
                Telstra will also try to prevent Australians from falling for scam messages. According to abc article
                (James Purtill,
                2022); "Of the $100 million Australians lost to phone scams in 2021, SMS scams accounted for 10 per
                cent." Blockchain
                solutions will help make verifying documents easier and reduce disruptions caused by DDoS attacks.

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Attackers / Crackers</div>
            <div class="detail_content">As defences get better, new attack vectors will be abused. Attacks may turn to
                more phishing and spear phishing attacks
                to trick users, rather than trying to defeat hardened systems. Social engineering may also be used to
                trick staff to
                give out information or make a payment thinking the contact is legitimate. Data pollution may also be
                explored, to
                weaken AI based protection by introducing garbage data during their unsupervised training phase.
            </div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">How will this affect you, your family and friends?</div>
            <div class="detail_content">For friends and family, they will need to keep up with changes in technologies
                and use the latest tools available to
                secure their accounts and information. Password managers should also be adopted to prevent the usage of
                the same
                password across websites. Extra care will need to be taken when viewing emails and text messages. They
                will also need to
                be aware of newest tactics cyber criminals use to try steal money or information. For me on an end user
                perspective,
                evolving cybersecurity technologies only stand to benefit me and help prevent unauthorised access to my
                information.
                From an IT professional point of view, there will be new technologies that I need to learn, whether it
                is so I can
                implement it in future software products or simply keeping up with the rest of the industry. If I work
                in the
                Cybersecurity industry, then I will need to continue making improvements to new technologies, then think
                of any possible
                weaknesses in their implementation. Finally, continue learning new ways attackers try to breach systems
                and actively
                fight against it.

            <div class="detail_line">Clouds, services, servers</div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle">What does it do?</div>
            <div class="detail_content">Clouds, services, servers are network clouds that break down huge computational
                data processing procedures into
                countless smaller procedures, which are processed and analysed by a system of multiple servers to obtain
                results and
                return them to the user. The level of this new technology allows the processing of tens of thousands of
                pieces of data
                in a matter of seconds, resulting in a powerful network service. As a result, the use of cloud services
                can reduce
                costs, i.e. reduce the cost and effort of purchasing, installing and configuring local infrastructure,
                and have greater
                flexibility, i.e. start using the relative applications very quickly without having to send requests and
                wait weeks for
                a response. Combining the most resources to improve network competitiveness, i.e. the ability to
                leverage the cloud
                provider's global network to bring applications closer to users from all over the world. For the time
                being, cloud
                services can offer three types of services, namely IaaS (Infrastructure as a service), PaaS (Platform as
                a service) and
                SaaS (Software as a Service). In IaaS services, user does not have permission to manage and access the
                underlying
                infrastructure, such as servers, switches, hard disks, etc., but has the right to manage the operating
                system, and
                storage content, to install and manage applications, and even to manage network components. In simple
                terms, if you use
                IaaS services, then it means that you do not need to sell your own servers, but you still need to
                install your own
                server software. Common IaaS services are virtual machines, virtual networking, and storage. PaaS gives
                users the
                ability to create, develop and deploy applications on the associated infrastructure using programming
                languages,
                libraries, services and development tools that are supported by the cloud service provider. Users do not
                need to manage
                the underlying infrastructure, including networks, servers, operating systems or storage. They can only
                control the
                application deployed on the operating system in the infrastructure and configure the configurable
                parameters of the
                environment in which the application is hosted. In other words, with PaaS services, it means that you
                neither need to
                buy a server nor install your own server software, but only need to develop your own website programs.
                Common PaaS
                services are database services, web applications and container services. SaaS gives users the ability to
                use
                applications from cloud service providers running on a cloud infrastructure. Applications can be
                accessed from a variety
                of client devices through a lightweight client interface or programmatic interface. The user does not
                need to manage or
                control the underlying cloud infrastructure, including the network, servers, operating system, storage
                or even
                individual application functions. If you take this a step further and purchase the services of some
                online forums or
                online shops, this means that you don't have to develop your own website, you just use the programs they
                have developed
                and they take care of the upgrades, maintenance, adding servers, etc. and you just need to concentrate
                on running them,
                like Gmail, Dropbox, etc.

            <div class="detail_subtitle">What is the likely impact?</div>
            <div class="detail_content">The impact of emerging technologies like the cloud, services and servers on
                today's society is very significant.
                Firstly, the cloud has helped business in a significant way, driving a lot of automation and intelligent
                business
                management and organisation. The cloud is a tool used by many business organisations to provide a way
                for companies to
                manage their resources online, helping them to reduce expenses and costs, so resources are only accessed
                when they are
                needed and then paid for based on usage, which not only reduces the need for labour, but also eliminates
                maintenance
                costs. At the same time, the cloud is very flexible, and users can decide for themselves whether they
                want to continue
                or stop using the service, or use a different cloud, without any restrictions. Secondly, the cloud also
                has an impact on
                workers. The cloud, the services, the servers create jobs for many people. The cloud can create a
                virtual workplace and
                managers can host various services on a central platform, so employees can access their workplace at any
                time while
                having a normal network. This not only provides work opportunities for many workers, but also promotes
                efficiency and
                reduces strain. Finally, the cloud also has an impact on society, reducing the carbon footprint of life.
                From social
                media to shopping; from watching movies to education, the cloud has become ubiquitous in our lives. And
                in the case of
                the Covid Virus epidemic this year, the cloud is gradually replacing many traditional ways of life, even
                more as many
                businesses and schools have mandated online meetings and education, arguably a change for the ages.
            </div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">How will this affect you?</div>
            <div class="detail_content">With the development of cloud technology, it has also gradually changed my daily
                life. I would regularly use social
                media applications such as Instagram, Twitter or WeChat and anything we posted was stored in the cloud
                on these social
                applications for us to review at any time. My entertainment has also changed. When I was a kid, I used
                to stay in front
                of the TV and watch the TV shows that were only on at that certain time, but then the cloud technology
                developed and
                applications such as YouTube, Netflix, and Spotify gave me the freedom to enjoy previous or latest
                movies, TV shows, or
                songs anytime, anywhere. There are also many influences in my academic life. In high school classes were
                more about
                listening to teachers offline, but in university a lot of learning is about watching online courses as
                the material is
                stored in the school cloud for students to use whenever they want. My friends have been influenced in
                much the same way
                as I have, but for my family, they have gradually changed from the older generation's attitude of buying
                everything in
                physical shops to accepting the use of online shopping applications such as Amazon, eBay, and Taobao to
                make life
                easier.
