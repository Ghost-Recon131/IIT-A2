            <div class="detail_content">Didn’t study it, civil engineering (Philippians) ~1yr. Didn’t enjoy as much,
                different construction sites.
                Eventually ~early 2000, start of internet boom, lot of opportunity to get trained in IT.
                Got employed with company that provides training and certification, outsourced in USA. AT&T like telco,
                supporting US.
                Started at level 1 IT support, eventually moved up. Got more certification and training. Then moved to
                Singapore, as IT
                is in demand, got a good position. Progressed in career.
                Moved to Australia via skilled migrants as IT was also in demand.
