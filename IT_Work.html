            <div class="detail_subtitle"> Interview Questions to be asked </div>
            <div class="detail_content">The following interview, which was done by the members Praniv and Henry, is on Randy Bustamante a
              Filipino father who currently resides in Victoria in Deenside with his wife and son. He is currently a Senior Network Engineer
            </div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">What kind of work do you do in the IT field and what is your current position? </div>
            <div class="detail_content">Mr Bustamante stated that his current title in his job was the “Senior Network Engineer”,
               and his day-to-day activities in work consist of mostly “designing”, “implementing”, and “planning”.
               He mentioned that the company he works for currently has a “new branch” in which they “decide how traffic will
                flow”, and “how to secure traffic”, he also mentioned the inclusion of the management of “inter regional communications”.
                 He also engages in ensuring that people in his workplace are working on their “assigned tasks” and that he assists in
                 “troubleshooting complex problems” around his company helping other staff. </div>
                 <div class="detail_subtitle">How did you get into the field of IT?  </div>
                 <div class="detail_content">Mr. Bustamante didn’t study IT and was studying “civil engineering”, in the Philippines and
                    he also worked as a civil engineer for about a “year or two”, however he stated that he really “didn’t enjoy it”.
                    This was due the fact that he constantly had to go to “different construction sites”.  Mr. Bustamante started in IT during
                    the “early 2000s” which was at the start of the internet boom” which meant that there were many “opportunities to get trained
                    in IT”, which he took advantage of and became employed with a “company that provides necessary training and certification”
                    which was “outsourced from the US” called “AT&T”. He started his journey and was “level 1 It support” but eventually moved up,
                     gained more “certification” and in his “training” and moved to “Singapore” as he stated that “It was high in demand” and
                     because he got a “good position”. He continued to progress in his career and ultimately “moved to Australia” as a
                     “skilled migrant” also due to the “demand of IT”. </div>
                     <div class="detail_subtitle">What made you interested in IT and want to make it your career?  </div>
                     <div class="detail_content">In terms of his interest in IT, Mr, Bustamante stated that he took thew opportunity of getting
                       training in IT and becoming employed because he was both “interested” and because it was in “demand”. He also added that
                       as he worked daily at this job that his “interest automatically grows” because IT essentially became a part of his daily
                       routine and because IT was a new concept at that time “everyone was learning about IT at the same time”. His thought process
                       at that time was that he will first start in IT and then will “decide whether” he “enjoys” it or not, he also stated that
                       he had “many paths to choose from” at “AT&T” and he choose to start “going down the network path”.  </div>
                       <div class="detail_subtitle">What were the steps and or prerequisites you had to obtain to successfully land your job?  </div>
                       <div class="detail_content">Mr. Bustamante didn’t do a “computer course” as at the time when he initially got into IT and got his job,
                          there were no “real computer courses at UNI in the Philippines” and he also stated that “parents wouldn’t encourage children to go
                          into brand new courses” because they “don’t really have an idea of what It was”.  Mr. Bustamante expressed that his parents would have
                          had the same outlook on IT had he “decided to study IT”. He continued to state that his parents whom “didn’t know much about IT,
                          did not know how to use computers and even did not own a smart phone” would not have been able to “influence” him onto an IT career pathway,
                          and that the only person who could “influence” him was him. The skills he needed for the job were learnt “on the job” and he was also given
                          “training and certification”.  </div>
                          <div class="detail_subtitle">10 years ago, did you see yourself in the position you are in today, professional career wise? and in another
                            10 years where do you see yourself in the IT field?  </div>
                          <div class="detail_content">Mr. Bustamante when asked about his current position voiced that he was “practically already at the top in
                            Network and Security” and further continued to describe the managerial and technical “paths of IT” and distinguished the two as “mangers focus
                            more on managing team and people, they don’t do much of the IT work like the technical side”. 10 years ago, Mr. Bustamante did not envision himself
                            in his “current position”, as back then he was still in “Singapore”, and he stated that these times were a “struggle” for him. He thanks luck as the
                            reason for him being in Australia as he stated, “it was a matter of luck, as my friend was applying to come to Australia”, and he decided to follow in
                            his friends’ footsteps, but he claims that he could have ended up in other counties like “USA” instead of Australia.
                            In 10 years, time, Mr. Bustamante seems himself working on “cloud technologies” and “security certifications” as he explained that in the IT field, there
                            is a need to “constantly update your knowledge and learn new technologies” otherwise you could be “left behind”. </div>
                            <div class="detail_subtitle">How would you define the importance of IT in today's day and age, do you think it is almost essential to have some sort of background in IT for the future?  </div>
                            <div class="detail_content">Mr. Bustamante’s opinion on whether IT is now essential or not was that he thought people “should know IT devices function”
                              and should be versed “in some areas of IT”. His main reasoning for this response was so that “people have at least a basic knowledge of IT which can
                              help them stay safe online especially when dealing with scammers”. He continued and mentioned that he “encourages people to get into IT” and stated that
                              there are “many fields to be interested in”. He believes that IT is as important as the “medical field” as technology is “constantly present”.
                                <div class="detail_subtitle">What type of people do you interact with? Other IT professionals? Clients? Investors?  The public? </div>
                                <div class="detail_content">Mr. Bustamante regularly interacts with “other technical staff” especially when they have “issues connecting two sites”.
                                  He also stated that he also “communicates with other managers and end users”.  </div>
                                <div class="detail_subtitle">What aspect of their job is the most challenging? </div>
                                <div class="detail_content">Mr Bustamante found “interacting” and “communicating “with other people the hardest. This was because he felt that the
                                  “demands” of “other people” were “unreasonable”, or that it interrupts his ‘timeline”. He gave an example that sometimes “unrealistic timeframes are set”
                                  and he may sometimes need to “adjust schedules to work with the client”.</div>
                                  <div class="detail_subtitle">What would you identify as your favourite aspects of your current job?
                                    Do you wake up feeling motivated to work because you love what you are doing?  </div>
                                  <div class="detail_content">Mr. Bustamante proclaimed that one of his favourite parts about the job is “working from home”, while he said it as a joke, stated that he truly does like
                                    working from home as he can cut down travel times and its more comfortable at home. Mr. Bustamante also loves the “designing” aspect of his job, he loves “building something up from scratch”.
                                    He loves seeing something that he made “working properly and helping a lot of people”, he says that it makes him feel good as it is a “good sense of accomplishment” from building a “product from scratch”. </div>
                                    <div class="detail_subtitle">Do you utilise your IT skills outside of just your job? If so, how?  </div>
                                      <div class="detail_content">Mr. Bustamante mostly does use his IT skills outside of work, mostly just to “set up computing devices”,
                                        “helping to troubleshoot”. He jokingly stated that he was essentially “everyone’s free IT support”.  In further consideration of the technical aspect,
                                         he stated that he applies the same “planning methodology”, he uses for his job to everything he does in life. He gave an example,
                                         where he applies the method of “drawing it first”, “analysis”, “review”, “implementing then testing”, and he even implements this with things like “woodworking”. </div>
                                           <div class="detail_subtitle">Are you also responsible for other aspects of cybersecurity or only for security in networking? </div>
                                           <div class="detail_content">Mr. Bustamante is also responsible for handling “cybersecurity”, “escalations in issues”, although he also mentioned that after a “merger”
                                              he is now stuck with “architecture and cybersecurity architecture” and the most annoying he said was “logging all the issues in networks”.
