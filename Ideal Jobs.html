            <div class="detail_content">Looking through everyone’s ideal job, one core skill that is
                  consistently required is having good communication skills. Having good communication skills
                  is vital as it has applications to most if not all jobs. Being able to effectively communicate
                  with your peers and colleagues allows for a better understanding when it comes to tackling a
                  certain topic or problem. In certain scenarios where a part of the job isn’t clear, having
                  someone else to explain or provide another outlook on the problem can vastly improve the way
                  one deals with said problem and improve the quality of the work. In more collaborative situations
                  having good communication allows teams to know the pace that the work is being done at. It helps
                  determine what tasks have been done and ones that need to be worked on to ensure the job is done
                  on time. There are other soft skills such as teamwork, learning mentality and adaptability which
                  also pop up but none as prominent as having good communication skills. For the other skills, since
                  everyone had different ideal jobs, the skills required vary between each person. Each job had
                  different skills and experience needed to suit the requirements so there were very few times when
                  certain members had to develop similar skills to each other apart from the soft skills due to the
                  difference of the jobs. Each plan is similar to each other as each person identifies what they are
                  currently lacking for their ideal job, then provide a general plan for how they want to tackle and
                  obtain the necessary skills and experience required for each job.
