        <div class="detail_content"><p><p>Although you could argue that majority of general skills are required in any occupation, when looking at the teams’ ideal occupations, no one’s ideal occupation explicitly
          listed the following skills as required …  </p></div>

                <li>

        <div class="detail_subtitle2">Yuxuan   </div>
        <div class="detail_content"><p><p>After looking at these data I do not think I would change my original ideal occupation. Although the Burning Glass shows that Software Engineers are only ranked 10th in terms of
          job requirements and are not a particularly popular type of occupation, however, the general skills in demand are Problem Solving, Teamwork, Analytical Skills and Multi-Tasking which I have, and I believe I have a great opportunity in the position of Software Engineer. But in any case, the most important thing is that I am interested in this position.   </p></div>
          <div class="detail_subtitle2">Danny    </div>
          <div class="detail_content"><p><p>Looking through the data I will continue to pursue my current ideal occupation of data analyst. My ideal profession falls under the system analyst section and is still currently a sought-after role so there is hopefully still demand once I’ve acquired the necessary skills and experience. However, one of the general team
             skills that I need to work on is my communication skills which currently has 44,367 job postings.  </p></div>
             <div class="detail_subtitle2">Praniv     </div>
             <div class="detail_content"><p><p>No with further consideration after viewing the data, my ideal occupation has not changed, and it remains to be a Business It Analysist. My occupation fell under the “system analysist” section which was shown by data to be popular in the last 12 months and had “11,492” postings. One of the most important skills required
               in this job was communication skills, which was also the highest general skills ranked among the team with 44,367 job postings requiring great communication skills.   </p></div>
               <div class="detail_subtitle2">Daniel      </div>
               <div class="detail_content"><p><p>Looking at the given data, I would choose to continue with my current choice as Security Analyst, as it is neither popular nor unwanted, being ranked 13th overall, and is still something that interests me compared to occupations at the top. Being a security analyst would require me to communicate well with my clients, and
                  solve security issues with others, which match well to the common general skills that employers look for. </p></div>

                  <div class="detail_content"><p><p>After Looking through this data the short answer is yes, I have changed my ideal occupation. As the Burning Glass data has indicated the demand for Network Engineers is not high and neither are the skills that are required for a specific Network Engineering role. Looking at the data I might want to consider looking at a Network/System
                    Administrator role instead as it is a lot more in demand showing 9,830 postings, which is around 6,000 more than a Network engineering role. </p></div>

                    <div class="detail_content"><p><p>After reviewing the data, I decided not to change my ideal occupation. “Skills Priority List Occupation” document states that ‘ICT Security Specialist ‘is in strong demand in all states across Australia. ACS article states that “Australia, for example, still needs 25,000 more cyber security workers to close its cyber security gap, (ISC)2 said…”  (David Brau, 2021).
                      The need for more security experts is also growing (ISG Provider Lens, 2021) thus, I do not believe it will be a difficult to find a job if I have the necessary experience. </p>
