            <div class="detail_subtitle">Overview</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                This project will propose the use of AI models and machine learning to boost cybersecurity defence for an organisation.
                By using all endpoints (individual computers / devices for each employee), server usage data and running alongside applications,
                the AI model will have far more data to work with compared to current antivirus or business security solutions.
                Thus, will help circumvent with attacks that rely on compromised accounts or zero-day attacks in addition to the usual malware attacks.
                The necessary hardware is already available, currently ‘only’ an AI model and time is needed.
                There is also a demand for using AI to enhance cybersecurity, thus making this product
                profitable once all technical details are worked out and a fully developed product is ready to hit the market.
            </div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Motivation</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                According to a study by Stanford University, “88% data breach incidents are caused by employees’ mistakes”
                (CISOMAG, 2020). As human error is the primary cause of cybersecurity incidents, there is a market for more
                advanced cybersecurity software beyond the usual email, links and virus scans most existing solutions offer.
                In a separate study by IBM, human error is the main cause of 95% of cyber security breaches. In other words,
                if human error was somehow eliminated entirely, 19 out of 20 cyber breaches may not have taken place (Micke Ahola, 2019).
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Another aspect is improving Protection against 0-day attacks. As documented in Google’s report
                (Maddie Stone and Clement Lecigne, 2021), there has been a consistent uptick in 0-Day vulnerabilities
                detected following 2018. Furthermore “Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity will
                grow from US $1billion in 2016 to a US $34.8 billion net worth by 2025” (Taddeo, McCutcheon and Floridi, 2019),
                thus making this a financially viable investment.
            </div>


            <div class="detail_subtitle">Description</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                First, this product needs to reach feature parity with current business cybersecurity solutions.
                Such as offering malware/ virus scans, firewall, email and link scanning, and a behaviour analysis module
                using a combination of a signature-based detection and a generalised AI. This will also be the main line of
                defence for an organisation data is collected on all the endpoint devices belonging to the organisation,
                as well as their servers. Endpoint data will contain usage data, permissions, usage times, access times,
                actions taken etc. These can then be used to train the AI on the usage patterns of each employee.
                The same can be done on the organisation’s servers and deployed programs, also monitoring how they are used
                and the usual traffic, throughput, and dataflow.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Training the AI to fit the organisation’s uses is time and resource intensive. To minimise the time needed,
                “Adaptive Deep Reuse” can be used as outlined in (M2 Presswire, 2019), which can reduce training time by around 60%,
                depending on the datasets, without loss in quality. This AI model then works though detecting anomalies
                such as sudden change in usage patterns or access times, missed by relying on signature-based detection alone (Stevens, 2020).
                However, the primary complication in creating a reliable Anomaly-based detection is getting data that is known to be
                free from attacks. This step likely requires manual validation of all the data to ensure the training model
                does not become ‘poisoned’.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle2">Implementation details</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                The product will also integrate Specification based detection, which is used to complement the Anomaly-based detection.
                This detection method uses “manually developed specifications that characterize legitimate behaviours rather
                than relying on machine learning algorithms” (Sikos, 2019). But this also increases complexity to setup but
                will reduce the number of false positives from the AI model.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Once in operation, the AI would be able to detect attacks using compromised employee accounts, such as sudden
                increase in data access, or trying to visit unknown sites or servers. The model should also detect malicious
                activity from the employee themselves, such as trying to access and copy company intellectual property.
                Furthermore, there will be additional protection against human error, such as improper configuration by
                system admins. When detected, a persistent warning will be issued until the problem is rectified, likely
                preventing an Equifax 2017 style data breach. Where “Equifax had crucially failed to renew an encryption
                certificate on one of their internal security tools” (Fruhlinger, 2020), thus allowing the attackers to
                steal data while Equifax system admins had no idea that anything was wrong.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle2">Software to be created</div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle3">SDK to integrate into other software</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Another crucial feature is offering clients the ability to integrate some protecting into their program via an SDK.
                The protection is aimed at detecting potential breaches due to vulnerabilities due the way it is coded or flaws in the
                program dependencies. It is not aimed to replaces source code analysis tools like “FlawFinder, RATS, ITS4”
                (Source Code Analysis Tools | OWASP Foundation) etc. Security vulnerabilities that arise due to the program’s
                dependencies is prevalent such as Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638 which allowed for remote code execution (RCE) on
                the program’s servers (Syme, 2017). Late last year, Log4j also had a RCE vulnerability. This month, the author of
                Node-IPC added malicious code in their package which essentially deletes all files on the server if the IP address
                of the server is physically in Russia or Belarus (NVD - CVE-2022-23812). Thus, the features are aimed at detecting,
                blocking, and doing some basic analysis on these attacks.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle3">Endpoint software + Logging and data collection & additional features </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                The product needs to have built in logging tools. This feature is responsible for logging all the usage
                data for all the endpoints and servers. It will be installed like any other antivirus and replace the device’s
                default antivirus software if it has one. It also has the features of a normal antivirus with signature and
                basic behaviour-based threat detection. This will lower the chance of successful attack when not connected
                to the company’s server hosting the AI model.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Its second job is to collect data in the background, and this requires no human interaction. This software
                runs on the company’s server and ‘cleans up’ all the log files it receives. It also converts the data into
                usable datasets (Pant, 2019). Data scientists may access the logs at this point to check that everything is
                being processed correctly. The logs are then sent to a separate server for data cleaning before it is passed
                to AWS infrastructure for storage as datasets for the ML model to train with.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                The product will also offer network intrusion detection. This feature is aimed at protecting devices on
                the organisation’s internal network and countering attackers who have evaded anomaly and specification
                detection. It is also using behaviour-based detection, but the AI will mainly focus on the user and internet
                packets to detect attacks. Malware detecting using electromagnetic waves (Ashley Whittaker, 2022) could
                also be integrated into the product.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle3">ML Web based application</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                This application focuses on training the ML model itself. It will use “80% of the dataset provided to develop
                the model while the remainder 20% is used as the testing set” (Nantasenamat, 2021). Cross validation then
                happens to check the validity of the model and whether it is useful.
                <br> </br>
                Based on findings in “Performance Comparison and Current Challenges of Using Machine Learning Techniques in Cybersecurity
                “(Shaukat et al., 2020), the following models will be chosen for the creating the ML model:
                <ul>
                    <li> Intrusion detection: Support Vector Machine (SVM) as it has around 98% for accuracy and precision.
                        But if a client wants the model ready quicker with minimal impact to accuracy, Decision Tree (DT)
                        will be used instead. The main drawback for SVM is that it is computationally expensive and requires
                        datasets from different periods of time for optimal results. For maximal accuracy, SVM, DT,
                        Naïve Bayesis (NB) and Random Forest should be used together.   </li>
                    <li> Malware detection: Deep Belief Network will be used as it maintained consistent results across
                        all datasets while Random Forest and Decision Tree learning techniques varied depending on the
                        dataset it was given. </li>
                    <li> Spam detection: NB optimal for spam protection as it outperformed all other learning techniques in this area.
                        Further optimisation can be achieved by combining NB with Random Forest. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle3">Admin management software</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Finally, a management program is needed for system admins to control the software. This frontend will tie
                in with all features offered by the product. This will allow system admins to manage organisation wide
                deployment of our endpoint software, as well as control the SDK if needed by their DevOps team. All warnings,
                notifications, and requests for the admin to act will also be viewed and dealt with in the management program.
                It will also allow for tinkering with manually defined specifications used for Specification based detection.
                Any action taken by the system admin also requires a hardware 2FA token, such as a Google or Yubico Security key.
                This requirement will prevent an attacker from performing any action on the admin panel remotely, as the hardware
                security keys require a physical touch before they authenticate its user (Stina Ehrensvard, 2018).
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                To try to increase usability of this product for even beginner system admins, the management program will
                need a windows style design. Where it does not look daunting for the user and has pre-configured settings
                for common cases but allow for power user to tinker with any setting they need.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle2">Self-Healing capabilities</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Through how this system operates, it is capable of self-healing, as it can continue to function when under attack,
                “resilient system able to carry out normal activities even when under attack” (Degeler, French and Jones, 2016).
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                When an attack is detected either on the endpoint device or by the organisation’s server, it will attempt
                to block the malware from executing. If it fails or was too slow, that endpoint will be automatically moved
                to a virtual subnet and prevented from connected to other devices. At this point system admins are notified,
                and unaffected devices keep functioning as normal. In an external software integrated with our SDK, it will
                block the attack and automatically log attack details, such as type of exploit used, attempted actions and
                origin IP. These details are sent to the developers of the software, and they can choose whether they want
                to involve law enforcement. While this happens, normal use remains unaffected, and users will not notice
                anything. See figurer 3 for an example of this in action.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle2">Market Analysis</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                "The global Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) market is anticipated to rise at a considerable
                rate during the forecast period, between 2022 and 2028" and "The global Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
                (IDPS) market size is projected to reach USD 7023.2 million by 2028, from USD 5053.1 million in 2021, at
                a CAGR of 4.7% during 2022-2028." (marketwatch, 2022).
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                From this data, we can see that the demand for IDPS is expanding and thus, we will need to worry about
                entering a stale or declining market. The target audience for this project are large organisations,
                companies, schools, and government agencies. These groups have many endpoints and helps to further enhance
                our project as predictions will be more accurate with more data to train the ML model. These groups are
                also far more likely to spend money on advanced IDPS systems. This can be operated as SaaS where the
                customer sources their own hardware or IaaS where they choose to depend on our infrastructure as well as the software.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Meanwhile our SDK can be targeted to developers of websites or applications that is open to the internet.
                Our endpoint software can be customised to be an antivirus / malware solution for end users. It would have
                the logging tools removed and then rebranded as AV software, while keeping the ability to use a generalised
                AI model for increased protection. Both would be licensed out using a SaaS model, securing continuous
                income in the long term.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_subtitle2">Competing products</div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                Our main competator will be existing companies that offer a similar IDPS system, such as providers from
                CISCO’s Secure IPS (NGIPS) (Cisco, 2022), Fireye’s Network Security and Forensics (FireEye, 2022),
                Paloaltonetworks’ enterprise IPS (paloaltonetworks, 2022) and Dartrace’ Enterprise Immune System (darktrace, 2022) etc.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                While some of the offered product’s state that they use AI in their products, our solution offers a
                system where further fine tuning can be done. This is done by training a specialised ML model for the
                customer based off devices on their network. Which is beneficial to anomaly detection, as a generalised
                model likely need to be less sensitive to avoid constant false positives. Another selling point is an
                external SDK which can be integrated into existing software. So far there some of the previously mentioned
                companies offer protection for cloud-based infrastructure but not at a software level. This can be used by
                developers to protect their programs and data from 0 day attacks, rather than just their hardware and infrastructure.

            <div class="detail_content">
                Once the project is successful, the chances of successful attack using zero-day vulnerabilities should be
                significantly reduced or even eliminated at the cost of more false positives. Once the effectiveness is
                proven and more organisation uses this software, there will be sizable profits to be made. The original
                problem of relying on signature and generalised AI models for protection will be replaced by specialised
                AI models that use all the data available to help secure an organisation. This should result in far less
                cases of human error leading to data being compromised and cases of RCE. But hackers will likely try creating
                more advanced techniques to breach organisations resulting in a constant “arms race” and continued
                improvements and updates are needed for the project.
