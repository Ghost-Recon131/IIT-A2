            <div class="detail_subtitle">Daniel</div>
            <div class="detail_content">Hey! I'm Daniel, and I'm a current 1st year student! I have a Vietnamese
                background, but have resided in Australia since
                birth. I have a general interest in the art, music and crafts people make, but most of all I am a fan of
                gaming,
                spending most of my days levelling up and progressing in various games, or experiencing the worlds and
                stories
                developers and creators have made. I think my enjoyment with IT would come from the creativity and
                versatility that IT
                is capable of. Being able to basically do anything with IT as long as you know the workings and options
                of a game engine
                or code seems cool to me. I have finished a "Partial Completion in Certificate III Information, Digital
                Media and
                Technology" VCE VET course during College, which was a great appetiser into the world of IT!</div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Phoebe</div>
            <div class="detail_content">I am a born Australian, and some of my interests include playing video games and
                creating mods for The Sims 4. I also
                have a miniature sausage dog named Bert who I consider my child. I first became interested in IT from my
                job at
                Ingenico. My role involves providing level 2 technical support for McDonalds (AU and NZ) and NAB EFTpos
                machines. I was
                studying a Bachelor of Accounting, but as I learnt more about IT and technical troubleshooting, I
                decided that IT was
                what I wanted to study, so I switched into a Bachelor of Business Information systems. My IT knowledge
                at the moment is
                very limited to POS and EFTpos systems but as of late I have been trying to get into coding and analysis
                of IT systems.
                I have also used my knowledge of python to create mods for games such as the Sims4 and Fallout 4.</div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Praniv</div>
            <div class="detail_content">My name is Praniv Basnet, born in Nepal but I have been in Melbourne since I was
                6 years old. In terms of my academic
                studies, I have mainly been invested in business ever since high school, being awarded the dux in my
                year 12 graduation
                for the highest score out of my year level in business management. I love to play video games as they
                are fun and help
                me relax, and playing with friends is even better. I also played soccer in High School, but nowadays I
                mostly go to the
                gym and hang out with friends. I have recently been interested and started watching Mixed Martial Arts,
                especially the
                UFC. My interest in IT in my final semester was because I felt like marketing as a minor wouldnâ€™t do
                much for me, hence
                I choose IT because it is a skill which can be very useful, and there are many jobs relating to it. A
                lot of my friends
                also picked it, and whilst they mentioned it was a lot of work, they also told me it is a crucial skill
                highly in demand
                today. For me I also thought that it could help with my own business endeavours such as being able to
                create a website
                myself and learning how to code can lead into different business ideas. Prior to this semester, I had no
                real experience
                in IT other than the required classes taught back in high school.</div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Jingxuan</div>
            <div class="detail_content">I immigrated to Australia from China with my parents back in 2008, maintaining a
                conversational level of both Mandarin
                and Cantonese, which has come in handy multiple times such as in group work or helping international
                students. I am also
                a PC enthusiast and gamer, keeping myself informed with the newest hardware releases, and have built
                around 6 PC's both
                for myself and family / friends. I've also done self-study on using penetration testing tools in Kali
                Linux and
                challenges on sites like Hack The Box and TryHackMe over the semester breaks and holidays. Another
                interest of mine is
                gaming. I've played Rainbow Six Siege, along with various COD and Battlefield releases, War Thunder, GTA
                5 and some
                others. I also played competitively as part of the RMIT team back in 2020.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                My primary interest in IT was in cybersecurity, however my interest started when the existing computer
                at home wasn't
                powerful enough to run my favourite games roughly back in 2014. I started looking at computer hardware,
                and further
                research got me interested in custom PC builds. Since then, I've had to deal with all the IT problems my
                parents have,
                getting me to set up anything with internet or smart home capabilities.
                I don't have any formal work experience in IT, but I have set up a lot of tech equipment at home. I set
                up the router
                and mesh nodes for Wi-Fi, smart home devices, security camera systems, a Network attached storage (NAS)
                and internal
                network shares over SMB and FTPS. To address the issue of securely connecting to these devices from an
                external network,
                I've then set up an OpenVPN server at home which can be reached via a DDNS service.

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Danny</div>
            <div class="detail_content">I have a Vietnamese background, and enjoy playing games. My main interest in
                studying IT is how flexible and diverse it
                is. IT always seemed to be a good baseline as it has a multitude of other routes to specialise in such
                as data analysis,
                cybersecurity, networking, software development, etc. I did not have an exact sort of course I wanted to
                focus on, and
                hope that by studying IT, I will still have a variety of options to choose from while I determine what I
                want to do.</div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Yuxuan</div>
            <div class="detail_content">My name is Yuxuan Jia, and my English name is Isaac. I come from China. I left
                China in Year 8 to study in Australia,
                and have lived in Australia for over four years. I love playing with my cats, talking to them, and
                having my ragdoll cat
                named Python lying on me for petting. I have always believed that Python is the best language in the
                world, and
                therefore, Python is the best cat in the world for me.</div>
            <div class="detail_content">An interest in IT came mostly from my family. My father is a programmer, and
                there are all kinds of programming books at
                home. However, MY interest in IT was that I could use my father's computer to play all sorts of games.
                When I was nine
                years old, I began to think about whether I could also make my own games. My father taught me Java in
                his free time.</div>

        <div class="detail_line">Team Profile:</div>
        <div class="detail_subtitle">Daniel</div>
        <div class="detail_content">In a team setting, I would be open to suggestions, inputting my ideas into the group
            and making the most to the best of
            my ability. However, I may lose attention, struggling to finish or end things in trying to perfect
            everything.</div>
        <div class="detail_content">My balanced learning would assist in understanding different methods of how notes
            are taken, and help explain ideas for
            others that may not understand the information given.</div>
        <div class="detail_content">I would do well in the creative side of projects, and may try to help others in
            their side of a project. However my
            introversion may limit me from doing so, and may instead act reserved in my section on a project.</div>

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Jingxuan</div>
        <div class="detail_content">I believe these results make me a versatile team member, adapting to multiple roles
            such as the group leader, or someone
            to help members on their tasks. I may also plan and review group work when discussing the assignment, as
            well as doing
            checks over the course of and at the end of the assignment.</div>

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Danny</div>
        <div class="detail_content">Although I may struggle as the leader of the group, I would do fine in any other
            position. While used to working by
            myself, I would improve on working with others and helping when I can in a group.</div>

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Praniv</div>
        <div class="detail_content">I would be able to brainstorm ideas quickly, working on a project early to try to
            get it finished quickly.</div>

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Phoebe</div>
        <div class="detail_content">Throughout the project I would be attentive to deadlines, being observant and social
            towards the group as I plan out the
            decisions to make
        </div>

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Yuxuan</div>
        <div class="detail_content">I enjoy helping others, often asking my members if my ideas would conflict with
            theirs, working to parallel them
            together. My creativity and enthusiasm would ensure that cooperating with my team would be beneficial and
            successful in
            a project.</div>
